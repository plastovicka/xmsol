After you start the game for the first time, you must use the menu command &nbsp; <tt> "Game" / "Change player" </tt> and create file for your <u>high scores</u> and <u>statistics</u>.

<h3>How to play</h3>
Cards can be moved by:
<ol>
<li> dragging by left mouse button - place the mouse pointer on a card, press the left mouse button, move the card to a new position and then release the mouse button. The mouse cursor is changed to up arrow whenever it is allowed to drop the card on a pile. 
<li> right click - click with right mouse button on a card. The computer decides where to move that card. It is fast, but it does not work well for all games. The computer sometimes doesn't choose a destination that you want. If you click a card which cannot be moved, your score will be decreased. 
<li> double-click - a card will be moved to a foundation or to a cell. If you have free cells and moreover some tableau columns empty, the double-click moves the card to a free cell whereas right-click moves the card to an empty tableau column. 
<li> click on stock pile - you can click on a stock by left or right mouse button. One or more cards will be moved according to game rules. Cards can be moved to a waste or to tableau piles. Sometimes a Redeal text appears when a stock is empty. Just click on it and all cards will be returned to the stock or tableau piles will be shuffled. It depends on a game rules.
<li> turn over a card - click on a face down card and it will be turned to face up. The game Blind Patience uses this rule. Most games turn over cards automatically.
</ol>

<h3>Options - Animation</h3>
If you switch the animation off, game will be faster, because cards appear instantly on a destination pile. 
<p>

<h3>Options - Display</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rounded card corners - set this value to zero if you have slow processor, because rectangular cards are painted much faster.
<li>Window borders - size of the empty space around the board
<li>Distance between cards in a tableau - Most games have vertical piles. Some games (e.g. Fan, Avenue) have horizontal piles. If you set distances too big, some cards may get out of a window. If you set distances too small, card numbers will not be visible.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Options - Score</h3>
<ul>
<li>Move to a foundation: score for every card that is placed on a foundation pile. Some games (e.g. Fan Nine) don't have any foundations. In such cases the score is calculated for every completed column. 
<li>Unhide a reversed card: Some games (e.g. Klondike) have several cards face down at the beginning of a game. After you get to hidden cards, they will be turned face up and the score will be increased.
<li>Undo: Penalty for using Undo function. It is not important how many moves are undone (e.g. you can return to the start of a game). The score is not changed if you redo moves just after they are undone. 
<li>Wrong move: Penalty for right-click on a card which cannot be moved.
<li>Redeal: Click on a "Redeal" button (when a stock is empty). Be careful especially when a stock has unlimited redeals because you can gain negative score. 
</ul>
