The court cards in this set were taken from a set of "trade
cards" produced in the United States of America in the late
19th century.  Trade cards were popular during this period
as premiums given away with the purchase of various products.
This set of cards was a transformation deck with images on
the pip cards as well as the courts.  Not all the cards were
available so only the twelve courts have images.

The court cards in this card set were originally published in 1819
by card maker J.Y. Humphreys of Philadelphia.  This is the earliest
known U. S. made "No Revoke" deck which means that each of the suits
has a different color.  In the original deck the Native American
chiefs were the Jacks.  But they were here first weren't they?  The
original back for this pack was unavailable.  The back chosen is a
late 19th century photograph of Chief White Buffalo.
