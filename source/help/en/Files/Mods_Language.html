		<h1>MODS - Language</h1>
		<p>Languages are simple text files containing text strings and their index (every string in the interface has its own index number). The file must be located in "language" folder and the file extension must be ".lng". File encoding must be Windows (ANSI in Notepad). Unicode is not supported. If you need English.lng file for translation, you can download it from the <a href="https://plastovicka.github.io" target="_blank">web site</a>.</p>
