		<h1>MODS - Game rules</h1>
		<p>Rules are simple XML files (standard text files using "extensible markup language" formating) located in the "Rules" folder. You shouldn't edit "standard.xml": create your own file instead as XMSolitaire will parse every XML file located in "Rules" on startup.<p>
		<h2>XML basic concept</h2>
		<p>XML files are human-readable text files designed to organize data using tags. Each tag describes a function and can include attributes, which provides further informations as how to process that function. Tags embed elements (tags, or other), which belongs to their parents:</p>
		<div class='codestart'>
			&lt;List&gt;
			<div>
				&lt;NewElement&gt;<br />
				<div>
					&lt;Name name="One" /&gt;<br />
					&lt;Color chroma="blue" /&gt;<br />
				</div>
				&lt;/NewElement&gt;<br />
			</div><div>
				&lt;NewElement&gt;<br />
				<div>
					&lt;ElementName name="Two" /&gt;<br />
					&lt;Color chroma="red" /&gt;<br />
				</div>
				&lt;/NewElement&gt;<br />
			</div>
			&lt;/List&gt;
		</div>
		<p>In the above example, &lt;List&gt; and &lt;NewElement&gt; are start-tags, &lt;/List&gt; and &lt;/NewElement&gt; are end-tags. &lt;Name /&gt; and &lt;Color /&gt; are empty-element tags (the tag close itself). Both &lt;NewElement&gt; tags belongs to (are elements of) &lt;List&gt;. Tags &lt;Name&gt; and &lt;Color&gt; are defined for each &lt;NewElement&gt;, both tags belong to their direct parent and so on. "name" is an attribute of &lt;Name&gt; and "chroma" is an attribute of &lt;Color&gt;, these tags (&lt;Name&gt; and &lt;Color&gt;) differentiate even further each &lt;NewElement&gt;.</p>
		<div class='codestart'>
			&lt;Paint color="blue"&gt;chair sheets car&lt;/Paint&gt;<br />
			water air<br />
			&lt;Paint color="red"&gt;box ashtray shoes&lt;/Paint&gt;<br />
		</div>
		<p>In this second example, a list of elements ("chair sheets car", "water air" and "box ashtray shoes") are to be painted. The first list will be paint in "blue", the second list will not be paint at all and the third list will be paint in "red".</p>
		<p>Even though both examples use random tag names, the concept remain the same: data is structured through the use of tags.</p>
		
<h2>Signature tag</h2>
		<p>The XML file must be signed properly for XMSolitaire to load it, use &lt;xmsol&gt; and &lt;/xmsol&gt; to encase your game rules.</p>
		<h3>Tags</h3>
		<div class='codestart'>
			&lt;xmsol&gt;<span>Tag content as an XMSol file.</span><br />
		</div>
		<h3>Attributes</h3>
		<p>There is no attribute for this tag.</p>
		<h3>Elements</h3>
		<p>&lt;game&gt; is a direct subtag of &lt;xmsol&gt;.</p>
<h2>Game tag</h2>
		<h3>Tags</h3>
		<p>Encase the rules of a game between &lt;game&gt; and &lt;/game&gt;. There can be more than one &lt;game&gt; tag per file, as long as each &lt;game&gt; is encased between the &lt;xmsol&gt; and &lt;/xmsol&gt; tags.</p>
